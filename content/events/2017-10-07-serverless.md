Serverless is your toolkit for deploying and operating serverless architectures. Focus on your application, not your infrastructure.

Develop, test and deploy in a single environment, to any cloud provider. You donâ€™t have to provision infrastructure or worry about scale. Serverless teams cut time to market in half.

In this six-hour workshop you will build a serverless application - using static hosting for a decoupled single-page-app frontend, and a Serverless backend.

Serverless backends are a combination of declarative infrastructure "wiring", and executable code. Deploying a serverless backend pushes the serverless functions into a cloud provider, and wires them up as you specified.

Focus on the business logic of your application, rather than configuring and maintaining the underlying infrastructure.

Serverless backends also handle scaling. Because the architecture is event-driven, when your code is not running, it is not costing you anything. When demand scales, serverless cloud backends scale with the workload.
